            <p>Brutalism, also known as Brutalist architecture, is a style that emerged in the 1950s and grew out of the early-20th century modernist movement.<br><br>Brutalist buildings are characterised by their massive, monolithic and ‘blocky’ appearance with a rigid geometric style and large-scale use of poured concrete. The movement began to decline in the 1970s, having been much criticised for being unwelcoming and inhuman.</p>

            <p>Brutalism became a popular style throughout the 1960s as the austerity of the 1950s gave way to dynamism and self-confidence. It was commonly used for government projects, universities, car parks, leisure and shopping centers, and high-rise blocks of flats.<br><br>With an ethos of ‘social utopianism’, together with the influence of constructivist architecture, it became increasingly widespread across European communist countries such as the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia.</p>

            <p>As high-rise buildings became associated with crime, social deprivation and urban decay, so Brutalism was increasingly reviled, and across the UK, many Brutalist buildings were demolished.<br><br>Brutalism could ultimately never escape its association with totalitarian regimes. In recent years, it has been critically reappraised, with certain buildings being seen as architectural landmarks.</p>

             <p>This spindly, conical water tower not only needs to hold nearly 2 million gallons of precious hydration for this growing region, between Johannesburg and Pretoria. The cone’s upper section was also designed to house a restaurant. Only the top half of the tower is filled with water. The vacant areas were designed to hold commercial space. Its creators refer to the building as an “urban sculpture,” and its spiraling, tornado-like form certainly makes it one of the most noticeable buildings in the area—and any area, really.</p>

      Kallmann McKinnell & Knowles
      Campbell, Aldrich & Nulty</p>
             <p>Boston City Hall is a controversial and prominent example of Brutalist architecture and part of the modernist movement. The building has been subject to widespread public condemnation, and is sometimes called one of the world's ugliest buildings. Calls for the structure to be demolished have been regularly made even before construction was finished. Architects and critics considered it to be excellent work, with one poll finding that professional architects describe City Hall as one of the ten proudest achievements of American architecture.</p>

      Pfohl, Roberts and Biggie</p>
             <p>The monolithic building's façade is dominated by large Precast concrete panels with narrow windows. Buffalo city court building is a 10-story high-rise building in downtown of Buffalo situated on a former site of Townsend Hall facing Niagara Square.The design was conceived by Buffalo architectural firm Pfohl, Roberts and Biggie's architecture firm with limited windows to keep the courtrooms and judges' chambers free from outside distraction. Because of its monolith structure, the building has by some been called the “epitome of Brutalist architecture.”

      Clorindo Testa and SEPRA</p>
             <p>One aspect of brutalism that's often overlooked is the airy interiors. For obvious reasons, architecture critics and fans alike tend to fetishize the hulking exteriors of these behemoths rather than the grandly spacious halls that are created by all that cold, hard concrete. The brutalist exterior is all about heaviness. But inside, a certain lightness abounds. BOLSA comes up again and again on lists and overviews about brutalism. It was included in an internationally traveling exhibition that celebrated the 20th century's most important works of architecture.

              <p>Location: London, England<br>Year Built: 1972<br>Architects: 	
      Ernő Goldfinger</p>
             <p>London was ground zero for brutalism because housing was in short supply after World War II and tall concrete towers were an expedient way to shelter large numbers of people. Trellick was once reviled, but it's now trendy and sought after, and respected in a cultish way. It stands at 98 metres (322ft) tall, featuring 31 floors. Though most of the units are still firmly held for social housing, when flats become available they sell quickly. A three-bedroom was recently on the market for just over $1 million.

      Pier Luigi Nervi & Pietro Belluschi</p>
             <p>The great Italian engineer-architect Pier Luigi Nervi was a master of concrete as much as Picasso was a master of paint. His work is rare in the U.S.; one of the most dramatic interior spaces ever created, it is enough to make the viewer believe more in the power of art and engineering than in the power of He who hath supposedly risen. Nervi pushed the limits of reinforced concrete to the extreme; maybe when visiting here we all should believe in God for safety reasons alone, given the extreme, logic-defying cantilevers and load-bearing abstractions on display.

            <p>In recent years, brutalism has seen a revival in the unlikeliest of places: digital interfaces. On the surface, the connection between brutalist architecture and websites seems tenuous, if not impossible. Brutalist architecture emphasizes raw materials, particularly concrete, but web design is obviously digital, devoid of physical materials—raw or otherwise. But the underlying traits of brutalism, namely authenticity and efficient construction, transcend genre. With brutalism entering the digital sphere, its visual characteristics are now more distinctly articulated through typography and color choices, expanding its reach to all manner of design applications. Brutalism rose from the ashes of war, gave shelter to the bereft, and 70 years later, its monuments are still standing. To get the most from it, remember its origins and how it made the face of design a little more brutally honest.</p>
